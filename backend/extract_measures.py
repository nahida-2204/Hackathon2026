    - Do not use the names of the sectors in the example above, replaceit with the actual sector of each individual prompt.
    - Be concise but specific (include mentioned budgets, timelines, or targets if present).
    - If a point is just political rhetoric without a concrete measure, skip it.
    - If there are no concrete measures for this sector in the context, reply exactly with empty json.
    - Do not invent or assume information.
